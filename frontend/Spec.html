                    <p>You will start with <a target="_blank">local backend development server</a>. The server is built
                        in Node, but it is very simple. You won't need to edit the server code; instead, your code will
                        talk to the server using documented API endpoints. You can use the server's endpoints to manage
                        storing, reading, updating, and deleting data for your application. </p>
                    <p>Using this server, you will build a React/Redux front end for the application. The specification
                        provided below is the minimum required for this project. You may extend your project however you
                        like, however, as long as the minimum specification is met.</p>

                <h2 id="data">Data</h2>
                <p>There are three types of objects stored on the server:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Categories</li>
                    <li>Posts</li>
                    <li>Comments</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="categories">Categories</h3>
                <p>The server supports a small, fixed number of categories that users can put posts into. Categories are
                    simple objects containing a name and a URL path (usually the same string). The server does not have
                    methods for creating/modifying/deleting these categories. If you wish to add to the categories for
                    your app, simply add your desired object to the Array in <code>categories.js</code> in the provided
                    server.</p>
                <h3 id="posts">Posts</h3>
                <p>Posts are the building blocks of your application. Posts include:</p>
